## 💡 Pro Tips for Using Voice Commands

### Best Practices

**✅ DO**:

1. **Speak clearly** - Enunciate your words
2. **Wait for "Listening..."** - Don't speak too early
3. **Use complete questions** - "What classes today?" works better than just "Classes"
4. **Be natural** - Talk normally, not like a robot
5. **Try variations** - If one phrase doesn't work, rephrase
6. **One command at a time** - Ask one thing per interaction

**❌ DON'T**:

1. **Don't whisper** - Speak at normal volume
2. **Don't rush** - Wait for the prompt
3. **Don't use very long sentences** - Keep it concise
4. **Don't speak too fast** - Normal pace is best
5. **Don't expect multi-step** - Can't do "Add 3 reminders then show schedule"
